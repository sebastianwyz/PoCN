Theoretical project:
Turing Patterns on complex Networks  0.3 pt
- the code and relative outputs are inside the TuringPattern folder

Practical project:
Public transport in large cities worldwide  1.2pt
- the code and relative outputs are inside the WorldCitiesNetworks folder, for each city a file containing nodes (nodeID,nodeLabel,latitude,longitude,mode,year) and a file containg edges (nodeID_from,nodeID_to,mode,line,year) are created, a final analysis shows the relation between N number of nodes and E number of edges.
